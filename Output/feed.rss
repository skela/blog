This is because the built in formatter offers nothing in the way of customization, you are in other words stuck with awful unreadable code indented with spaces.</p><p>So what is someone who still thinks code should always be indented with tabs, or prefers the Allman style, to do about that?</p><h3>Meet blink</h3><p>Well, I have been working on my own dart code formatter, <a href="https://github.com/skela/blink">blink</a>, the world's first customizable dart code formatter. Now its still not ready, but we do use it from time to time. My goal is to build a dart code formatter that's customizable via <a href="https://editorconfig.org/">EditorConfig</a> files.</p><h3>Using blink</h3><p>I was never able to figure out how to use my own code formatter for dart back when i was using VSCode, but now that I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">nvim</a> that might be different. Turns out yes, its a lot easier to do this sort of stuff using nvim, infact it took me only 5 minutes to get it up and running, including format on save!</p><pre><code>{
	"stevearc/conform.nvim",
	optional = true,
	opts = {
		formatters_by_ft = {
			["dart"] = { "blink" },
		},
		formatters = {
			blink = {
				command = "/home/skela/code/blink/target/release/blink",
				args = { "$FILENAME" },
				stdin = false,
				cwd = require("conform.util").root_file({ ".editorconfig", "Pubspec.yaml" }),
			},
		},
	},
},
</code></pre><h3>EditorConfig</h3><p>I've got this snippet below added to my <code>.editorconfig</code> file. blink looks for an .editorconfig in your code repo and your home directory.</p><pre><code>[*.dart]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 2
curly_brace_on_next_line = true
prefer_double_quotes = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

The dimensions of this particular strip were 11.8mm by 6mm. So <a href="https://openscad.org/">OpenSCAD</a> to the rescue. Made a simple cube, cut out a channel and added a screw hole.</p><h3>Making a 3D Model</h3><p>With OpenSCAD you can create 3D models using code, something I personally find much simpler than a graphical design tool. Its also a lot easier to adjust and modify these kinds of models, to fit other kinds of use-cases.</p><pre><code>led_thickness = 11.8;
led_height = 6;

bw = 20; // bracket width
bt = 2; // bracket thickness
lfh = led_height + 0.2; // channel height to fit the led strip
bd = 12; // bracket depth, needs to be bigger than led thickness

$fn=1000;

module bracket()
{
    difference()
    {
        cube([bw,lfh+bt,bd],center=true);
        translate([0,0,bt])
        {
            cube([bw+bt,lfh,bd+bt],center=true);
        }
    }
}

difference()
{
    bracket();
    translate([0,0,-5]) { cylinder(h=bt/2,r=2.4,center=true); }
    translate([0,0,-5]) { cylinder(h=bt*2,r=1,center=true); }
}
</code></pre><h3>Exporting as an STL file</h3><p>Once your happy with your design, you export it as an STL file, and then import that into the slicer / 3D printer software of your choice. Here I'm using <a href="https://ultimaker.com/">UltiMaker Cura</a>.</p><img src="https://alekslater.com/res/led_strip_bracket.png" alt="OpenSCAD Model"/><h3>Sequential Prints</h3><p>Printing a bunch of these would be a tad too tedious, if you had to do it 1 by 1. With UltiMaker Cura, you can set it to print sequentially. In this case, I was able to squeeze in 9 brackets every print, making the most of every square inch of my Ender 5 Pro build plate.</p><img src="https://alekslater.com/res/led_strip_bracket-sequential_print.png" alt="Sequential Print"/>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://alekslater.com/posts/Docker%20Log%20Overload</guid><title>Docker Log Overload</title><description>Avoiding your hard disks from filling up with junk due to excessive docker logging.</description><link>https://alekslater.com/posts/Docker%20Log%20Overload</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 22:50:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By adding logging parameters to your docker-compose.yml file services, you can avoid your hard drive from filling up.</p><pre><code>version: '3'
